A minecraft 1.17+ resourcepack

## Making other blocks sway

The resourcepack decides whether a block should sway or not based on the texture alpha, if it finds a block with a texture that has alpha 141 everywhere, it will activate. To enable this on blocks other than hanging lanterns, you need to edit the textures to be like this. An example can be found in `assets/minecraft/textures/lantern_hanging.png`
